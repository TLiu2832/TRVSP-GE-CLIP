# Transferring and Refining Visual-Semantic Priors via Graph-Enhanced CLIP for 3D Hand Pose Estimation

This is the official repository for **TRVSP-GE-CLIP**, a novel framework designed for **3D Hand Pose Estimation**.

ðŸš€ **Code Coming Soon!** The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

## ðŸ”¥ Introduction
In this work, we propose a **Graph-Enhanced CLIP** to deliver **visual-semantic priors** to DNNs and refine the **domain-specific knowledge** for better 3D hand pose estimation.
